Amalgam â€“ a Django blog engine
==============================

As the name suggests, this is mainly a collection of Django reusable
apps that taken together form a hopefully cohesive blog engine.

Most of this comes from [Mingus][], which I used to use, but this engine
is tailored more towards less database/runtime configuration and better
performance. In essence, this is a slimmed down version of Mingus where
the admin interface is used exclusively for dealing with content, not
configuration.
